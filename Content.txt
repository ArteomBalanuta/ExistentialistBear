Language bearers, Photographers, Diary Makers,
You with your memory are dead, frozen
Lost in a present that never stops passing
Here lives the incantation of matter
A language forever.

#-#-# Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, the definition of "double-think" #-#-#
The power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them. ...
To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient,
and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed,
to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one
denies all this is indispensably necessary. Even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to exercise
doublethink. For by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality; by a fresh act of doublethink
one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth.

#-#-# The Conspiracy Against the Human Race by Thomas Ligotti #-#-#
Thus, we are zealots of the four strategies delineated above:
solation: "Being alive is all right",
anchoring: "One Nation under God with Families and Laws for all",
distraction: "Better to kill time than kill oneself" and
sublimation: "I am writing a book titled The Conspiracy against the Human Race"

Nothing exists; even if something exists,
nothing can be known about it;
and even if something can be known about it,
knowledge about it can't be communicated to others.

#-#-# The forbidden room #-#-#
While military bands, play loud music
To stifle the screams, of those who
Drown in the harbour, four frightened men
Forty fathoms deep, entombed in silence
Hidden from God, behind the face of the sea
Behind the waves, that sing and flirt
On the face of the sea, four frightened men
Wonder at their fate, their cargo most dire
The captain mislaid, their breath in retreat
Their doom, mere moments away.

#-#-# Anton Chekhov, Three Sisters (Chebutikin) #-#-#
Maybe I didn’t break it, it just seems like I broke it. Maybe it just seems
like we exist at all, and we really aren’t even here. I don’t know anything
no one knows anything.

#-#-# Thomas Bernhard, In the cold #-#-#
We are mistaken if we believe we are in possession of the truth, just as
we are mistaken if we believe we are in error. Absurdity is the only way forward.

#-#-# Henry Miller, Sexus #-#-#
From the time you wake up until the moment you go to bed it’s all a lie, all a
sham and a swindle. Everybody knows it, and everybody collaborates in the
perpetuation of the hoax. That’s why we look so god damned disgusting to one another.
