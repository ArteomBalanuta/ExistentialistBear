You with your memory are dead, frozen
Lost in a present that never stops passing
Here lives the incantation of matter
A language forever.

#-#-# Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, the definition of "double-think" #-#-#
The power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them. ...
To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient,
and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed,
to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one
denies all this is indispensably necessary. Even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to exercise
doublethink. For by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality; by a fresh act of doublethink
one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth.

#-#-# The Conspiracy Against the Human Race by Thomas Ligotti #-#-#
Thus, we are zealots of the four strategies: solation: "Being alive is all right",
anchoring: "One Nation under God with Families and Laws for all",
distraction: "Better to kill time than kill oneself" and
sublimation: "I am writing a book titled The Conspiracy against the Human Race"

Nothing exists; even if something exists,
nothing can be known about it;
and even if something can be known about it,
knowledge about it can't be communicated to others.

#-#-# The forbidden room #-#-#
While military bands, play loud music
To stifle the screams, of those who
Drown in the harbour, four frightened men
Forty fathoms deep, entombed in silence
Hidden from God, behind the face of the sea
Behind the waves, that sing and flirt
On the face of the sea, four frightened men
Wonder at their fate, their cargo most dire
The captain mislaid, their breath in retreat
Their doom, mere moments away.

Maybe I didn’t break it, it just seems like I broke it. Maybe it just seems
like we exist at all, and we really aren’t even here. I don’t know anything
no one knows anything.

We are mistaken if we believe we are in possession of the truth, just as
we are mistaken if we believe we are in error. Absurdity is the only way forward.

#-#-# Henry Miller, Sexus #-#-#
From the time you wake up until the moment you go to bed it’s all a lie, all a
sham and a swindle. Everybody knows it, and everybody collaborates in the
perpetuation of the hoax. That’s why we look so god damned disgusting to one another.

Harry glanced at the drivers of the cars. They seemed unhappy.
The world was unhappy. People were in the dark. People were terrified
and disappointed. People were caught in traps. People were defensive and
frantic. They felt as if their lives were being wasted. And they were right.

To hell with reality! I want to die in music, not in reason or in prose.
People don’t deserve the restraint we show by not going into delirium
in front of them. To hell with them!

I wonder if he realizes that he has

There is much in being that man cannot master.
There is but little that comes to be known.
What is known remains inexact, what is mastered insecure.

I have no ambitions nor desires.

#-#-# Ernest Becker, The Denial of Death #-#-#
Man’s very insides– his self– are foreign to him. He doesn’t know who he is, why he was born,
what he is doing on the planet, what he is supposed to do, what he can expect.
His own existence is incomprehensible to him, a miracle just like the rest of creation, closer
to him, right near his pounding heart, but for that reason all the more strange.

What would the average man do with a full consciousness of absurdity? He has fashioned
his character for the precise purpose of putting it between himself and the facts of life;
it is his special tour-de-force that allows him to ignore incongruities,
to nourish himself on impossibilities, to thrive on blindness.

I want to sleep..
I want to sleep and dream a dream
of falling asleep and dreaming.
I want to laugh..
I want to laugh at myself, my laughter
and laugh at the thought.
I want to live
I want to live a life and be immortal
and die to prove me wrong.

#-#-# Diogenes of Sinope #-#-#
When asked how he wished to be buried, he left instructions to be thrown outside the city wall
so wild animals could feast on his body. When asked if he minded this, he said, "Not at all,
as long as you provide me with a stick to chase the creatures away!" When asked how he could
use the stick since he would lack awareness, he replied "If I lack awareness,
then why should I care what happens to me when I am dead?

#-#-# Giordano Bruno: His Life and Thought #-#-#
His home was in a hamlet just outside Nola, on the lower slopes of Cicada, a foot-hill of the Appenines
some twenty miles east of Naples. He tells with affectionate detail of the beauty and fertility of the
land around, overlooked from afar by the seemingly stern bare steeps of Vesuvius. One day a suspicion of the
deceptiveness of appearances dawned on the boy. Mount Cicada, he tells us, assured him that “brother Vesuvius”
was no less beautiful and fertile. So, girding his loins, he climbed the opposite mountain. “Look now,”
said Brother Vesuvius, “look at Brother Cicada, dark and drear against the sky.” The boy assured Vesuvius that
such also was his appearance viewed from Cicada. “Thus did his parents [the two mountains] first teach the lad
to doubt, and revealed to him how distance changes the face of things. In whatever region of the globe
I may be, I shall realize that both time and place are similarly distant from me.”
