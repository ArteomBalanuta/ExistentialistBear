#-#-# Begotten, E. Elias Merhige. 1991 #-#-#
  Language bearers, Photographers, Diary Makers,
  You with your memory are dead, frozen
  Lost in a present that never stops passing
  Here lives the incantation of matter
  A language forever.

  Like a flame burning away the darkness
  Life is flesh on bone convulsing above the ground

#-#-# Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, the definition of "double-think" #-#-#
  The power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind
  simultaneously, and accepting both of them... To tell deliberate
  lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that
  has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again,
  to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to
  deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take
  account of the reality which one denies all this is indispensably
  necessary. Even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to
  exercise doublethink. For by using the word one admits that one is
  tampering with reality; by a fresh act of doublethink one erases
  this knowledge; and so on indefinitely,
  with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth.


#-#-# The Conspiracy Against the Human Race by Thomas Ligotti #-#-#
  Thus, we are zealots of four strategies: solation:
  "Being alive is all right", anchoring:
  "One Nation under God with Families   and Laws for all",
  distraction: "Better to kill time than kill oneself" and sublimation:
  "I am writing a book titled The Conspiracy against the Human Race"

#-#-# Georgias: on nature or "what is not" #-#-#
  Nothing exists; even if something exists,
  nothing can be known about it;
  and even if something can be known about it,
  knowledge about it can't be communicated to others.

#-#-# The forbidden room #-#-#
  While military bands, play loud music
  To stifle the screams, of those who
  Drown in the harbour, four frightened men
  Forty fathoms deep, entombed in silence
  Hidden from God, behind the face of the sea
  Behind the waves, that sing and flirt
  On the face of the sea, four frightened men
  Wonder at their fate, their cargo most dire
  The captain mislaid, their breath in retreat
  Their doom, mere moments away.

  Maybe I didn’t break it, it just seems like I broke it. Maybe it just seems
  like we exist at all, and we really aren’t even here. I don’t know anything
  no one knows anything.

#-#-# Thomas Bernhard, In the cold #-#-#
  We are mistaken if we believe we are in possession of the truth,
  just as we are mistaken if we believe we are in error.
  Absurdity is the only way forward.

#-#-# Henry Miller, Sexus #-#-#
  From the time you wake up until the moment you go to bed
  it’s all a lie, all a sham and a swindle. Everybody knows it,
  and everybody collaborates in the perpetuation of the hoax.
  That’s why we look so god damned disgusting to one another.

#-#-# Charles Bukowski, Septuagenarian Stew #-#-#
  Harry glanced at the drivers of the cars. They seemed unhappy.
  The world was unhappy. People were in the dark. People were terrified
  and disappointed. People were caught in traps. People were defensive and
  frantic. They felt as if their lives were being wasted. And they were right.

#-#-# Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Journey to the end of the night #-#-#
  To hell with reality! I want to die in music, not in reason or in prose.
  People don’t deserve the restraint we show by not going into delirium
  in front of them. To hell with them!

#-#-# Fernando Pessoa, A factless autobiography #-#-#
  Whenever someone tells me he dreamed,
  I wonder if he realizes that he has
  never done anything but dream.

#-#-# Martin Heidegger, Poetry, Language, Thought #-#-#
  There is much in being that man cannot master.
  There is but little that comes to be known.
  What is known remains inexact, what is mastered insecure.

#-#-# Fernando Pessoa, The Keeper of Herds #-#-#
  I have no ambitions nor desires.
  To be a poet is not my ambition,
  It’s simply my way of being alone.

  All nihilists have wrestled with God.

#-#-# Ernest Becker, The Denial of Death #-#-#
  Man’s very insides– his self– are foreign to him. He doesn’t know
  who he is, why he was born, what he is doing on the planet, what
  he is supposed to do, what he can expect. His own existence is
  incomprehensible to him, a miracle just like the rest of creation,
  closer to him, right near his pounding heart, but for that reason
  all the more strange. What would the average man do with a full
  consciousness of absurdity? He has fashioned his character for the
  precise purpose of putting it between himself and the facts of life;
  it is his special tour-de-force that allows him to ignore
  incongruities, to nourish himself on impossibilities,
  to thrive on blindness.

  I want to sleep..
  I want to sleep and dream a dream
  of falling asleep and dreaming.
  I want to laugh..
  I want to laugh at myself, my laughter
  and laugh at the thought.
  I want to live
  I want to live a life and be immortal
  and die to prove me wrong.

#-#-# Diogenes of Sinope #-#-#
  When asked how he wished to be buried, he left instructions
  to be thrown outside the city wall so wild animals could
  feast on his body. When asked if he minded this, he said,
  "Not at all, as long as you provide me with a stick to chase
  the creatures away!" When asked how he could use the stick
  since he would lack awareness, he replied "If I lack awareness,
  then why should I care what happens to me when I am dead?

#-#-# Giordano Bruno: His Life and Thought #-#-#
  His home was in a hamlet just outside Nola, on the lower
  slopes of Cicada, a foot-hill of the Appenines some
  twenty miles east of Naples. He tells with affectionate
  detail of the beauty and fertility of the land around,
  overlooked from afar by the seemingly stern bare steeps
  of Vesuvius. One day a suspicion of the deceptiveness of
  appearances dawned on the boy. Mount Cicada, he tells us,
  assured him that “brother Vesuvius” was no less beautiful
  and fertile. So, girding his loins, he climbed the
  opposite mountain. “Look now,” said Brother Vesuvius,
  “look at Brother Cicada, dark and drear against the sky.”
  The boy assured Vesuvius that such also was his
  appearance viewed from Cicada. “Thus did his parents
  [the two mountains] first teach the lad to doubt, and
  revealed to him how distance changes the face of things.
  In whatever region of the globe I may be, I shall realize
  that both time and place are similarly distant from me.”

#-#-# Charles Seife - Zero #-#-#
  Yet through all its history, despite the rejection and the exile,
  zero has always defeated those who opposed it. Humanity could never
  force zero to fit its philosophies. Instead, zero shaped
  humanity’s view of the universe—and of God.

#-#-# JOHN DONNE, “AN ANATOMY OF THE WORLD” #-#-#
  And new philosophy calls all in doubt,
  The element of fire is quite put out;
  The sun is lost, and th’ earth, and no man’s wit
  Can well direct him where to look for it….’
  Tis all in pieces, all coherence gone;
  All just supply, and all relation:
  Prince, subject, Father, Son, are things forgot.

  Waclaw Sierpinski, the great Polish mathematician… was worried
  that he’d lost one piece of his luggage. “No, dear!” said his wife.
  “All six pieces are here.” “That can’t be true,” said Sierpinski,
  “I’ve counted them several times: zero, one, two, three, four, five.”

#-#-# WILLIAM THOMSON, LORD KELVIN #-#-#
  When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it
  in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot
  measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge
  is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind: it may be the beginning
  of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts,
  advanced to the stage of science.

  When, after a thousand-year stupor, European thought shook off the effect
  of the sleeping powders so skilfully administered by the Christian Fathers,
  the problem of infinity was one of the first to be revived.

#-#-# FRIEDRICH ENGELS, ANTI-DUHRING #-#-#
  With the introduction of…the infinitely small and infinitely large,
  mathematics, usually so strictly ethical, fell from grace…. The virgin
  state of absolute validity and irrefutable proof of everything
  mathematical was gone forever; the realm of controversy was inaugurated,
  and we have reached the point where most people differentiate and
  integrate not because they understand what they are doing but from pure
  faith, because up to now it has always come out right.

  Death is nothing to us, since when we are, death has not come,

#-#-# Thomas Bailey Aldrich, Identity (1922) #-#-#
  Somewhere, in desolate, wind-swept space, In twilight land, in no man's land,
  Two hurrying shapes met face to face, And bade each other stand.
  "And who are you?" cried one, a-gape, Shuddering in the glimmering light.
  "I know not," said the second shape, "I only died last night."

  When I lived, I provided for every thing but death;

#-#-# Darren Aronofsky, In The Fountain #-#-#
  Our bodies are prisons for our souls. Our skin and blood,
  the iron bars of confinement. But fear not. All flesh decays.
  Death turns all to ash. And thus, death frees every soul.

  When life is woe,

#-#-# The Tao of programming, Book 1 - The Silent Void #-#-#
  The Tao gave birth to machine language. Machine language gave birth to the
  assembler. The assembler gave birth to the compiler. Now there are ten
  thousand languages. Each language has its purpose, however humble.
  Each language expresses the Yin and Yang of software. Each language has
  its place within the Tao. But do not program in COBOL if you can avoid it.

  "For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote,
  "that there is no recollection which time does not put an end to,
  and no pain which death does not remove." "And what greater
  misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one that waits
  for time to put an end to it and death to remove it?"

  Dear, was it really you and I?
  In truth the riddle's ill to read,
  So many are the deaths we die
  Before we can be dead indeed.
